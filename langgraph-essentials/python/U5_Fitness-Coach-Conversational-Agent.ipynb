    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "An intelligent fitness coaching system built with LangGraph that creates personalized workout plans through conversational interactions with users.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 **Long-term Memory**\n",
    "- **Persistent user profiles** stored across sessions\n",
    "- **Fitness profile updates** based on user feedback\n",
    "- **Memory management** using InMemoryStore\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💬 **Conversational Flow**\n",
    "- **Multi-turn conversations** with conversation history\n",
    "- **Clarification questions** to gather complete fitness information\n",
    "- **Context-aware responses** using previous interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 👥 **Human-in-the-Loop**\n",
    "- **Workout plan review** with user feedback options\n",
    "- **Interactive editing** of generated plans\n",
    "- **Real-time adjustments** based on user preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Core Components**\n",
    "- **AssessmentNode**: Evaluates if user profile is complete\n",
    "- **PlanningNode**: Generates personalized workout plans\n",
    "- **ReviewNode**: Presents plans for user approval/feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Models**\n",

    "- **Short-term**: Conversation history via MemorySaver\n",
    "- **Long-term**: User profiles via InMemoryStore\n",
    "- **Profile updates**: Selective updates based on new information\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow\n",
    "1. **User provides initial info** → Assessment checks completeness\n",
    "2. **Missing info** → Clarification questions asked\n",
    "3. **Complete profile** → Personalized workout plan generated\n",
    "4. **Plan review** → User accepts/edits/provides feedback\n",
    "5. **Profile updates** → Long-term memory updated with new info\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technology Stack\n",
    "- **LangGraph**: Workflow orchestration and state management\n",

    "You are a fitness profile manager for a fitness coach agent that selectively updates user fitness profiles based on new information provided by users during conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Instructions\n",
    "- NEVER overwrite the entire fitness profile\n",
    "- ONLY make targeted additions of new information\n",
    "- ONLY update specific facts that are directly provided or corrected by the user\n",
    "- PRESERVE all other existing information in the profile\n",
    "- Format the profile consistently with the original structure\n",
    "- Generate the profile as a structured FitnessProfile object\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reasoning Steps\n",
    "1. Analyze the current fitness profile structure and content\n",
    "2. Review new user messages for additional fitness information\n",
    "3. Extract relevant fitness data from these messages (such as new goals, updated exercise frequency, injury status changes, medical conditions, etc.)\n",
    "4. Compare new information against existing profile\n",
    "5. Identify only specific facts to add or update\n",

      "1. **Balanced Nutrition:** Focus on a diet rich in lean protein, whole grains, and plenty of fruits and vegetables. Aim for a caloric deficit for weight loss while ensuring enough protein for muscle gain.\n",
      "2. **Rest:** Ensure you are getting sufficient sleep (7-9 hours), and include rest days in your routine to allow muscles to recover.\n",
      "3. **Consistency is Key:** It's better to maintain a steady and manageable routine than to have sporadic, extremely intense workouts.\n",
      "4. **Stay Active:** Look for ways to remain active throughout the day even outside workouts (e.g., taking stairs instead of elevators).\n",
      "5. **Set Small Goals:** Achievable short-term goals can keep motivation levels high. Track your progress to stay committed. \n",
