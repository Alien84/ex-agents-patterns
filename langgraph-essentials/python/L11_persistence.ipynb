    "LangGraph has a built-in persistence layer, implemented through checkpointers. When you compile a graph with a checkpointer, the checkpointer saves a checkpoint of the graph state at every super-step. Those checkpoints are saved to a thread, which can be accessed after graph execution. Because threads allow access to graph’s state after execution, several powerful capabilities including human-in-the-loop, memory, time travel, and fault-tolerance are all possible."

    "\n",
    "-   config: tells which thread you are updating (and optionally which checkpoint in that thread). If you only give the thread_id, you are updating the latest state in that thread. If you also give checkpoint_id, you are forking from that previous checkpoint.\n",
    "-   values: the new values you want to merge into the state. These values will be applied to the state channels (keys) defined in your state schema. Important: some channels might have reducers defined (meaning updates will append/merge rather than directly overwrite).\n",
    "-   as_node (optional): you can specify an as_node argument so that this update behaves as if it was emitted by that node in the graph. This affects which node is considered last executed and thus which next node(s) should run.\n",
    "    -   When you call graph.update_state(config, values, as_node=NODE_NAME), you are telling the system: “Treat this state update as if it came from the node called NODE_NAME.”\n",
    "    -   If you don’t explicitly provide as_node, the system will try to infer which node should be treated as the origin of the update — typically it uses the last node that updated the state, if that is unambiguous."
